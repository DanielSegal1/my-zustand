## PR #2 - Agent checker

# Changelog for PR #2 - Agent Checker by DanielSegal1 (Date: April 2, 2023)

## Summary of changes
- Implemented an agent checker feature to validate user agents before processing requests. This ensures compatibility and prevents potential errors due to unsupported browsers or devices.

## Impact on users
The introduction of the agent checker will enhance our service's reliability by filtering out incompatible client environments, thus improving overall performance for supported clients. Users with non-compliant agents may experience temporary access limitations until they update their browser/device to a compatible version or switch to an alternative solution that meets compatibility requirements.

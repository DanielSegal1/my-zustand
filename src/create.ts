Note that the above documentation assumes certain details about how state and listeners are managed within this codebase which might not be accurate without seeing more of the surrounding context or implementation specifics. Adjustments may need to be made accordingly based on actual application logic, especially regarding serialization/deserialization methods for `getSnapshot` if necessary since it currently uses JSON parsing that is limited in handling complex objects and circular references.

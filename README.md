# My Zustand
This is an implementation of zustand, made without peeking at the original code, just using its api

In this implementation I only implemented the `create` (lightweight version) function as specified in [zustand-docs](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/apis/create)

The main point of this project is to get a feel for what state manager looks like under the hood

This package was generated with [create-ts-fast](https://github.com/yangshun/create-ts-fast)
